# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value security for the project very highly. We encourage all users to report any vulnerabilities they discover to us.
If you find a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly by sending an email to zhb12345@gmail.com.

At this juncture, we don't have a bug bounty program. We are a small team trying to solve a big problem. We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly
so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
